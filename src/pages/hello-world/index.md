This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting! Now to bore you with the obligatory intros. My name is Nate and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer that primarily focuses on the frontend side of things. I'm married to my beautiful wife Karin and I have a 6, he'd kill me if I didn't say almost 7, year old son name Noah. I currently live in Orlando, FL and I love Dr. Pepper.

Phew! Got that out of the way and now we can move on to the much more interesting stuff. For this first post I wanted to talk about some really awesome animation libraries I've been working with lately. The primary ones I'm going to talk about will be Animate on Scroll (AOS) and Greensock Animation Platform (GSAP). I have been loving both of these libraries to add that little bit of polish to a website. Both GSAP and AOS are super easy to implement into your project and with some experimenting you can do just about anything you want.

From fades and easing to rotations and zooms, GSAP can do just about any animation you can think of. It takes some work getting used to but once you get the hang of tweens you can really go crazy with this library.

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
